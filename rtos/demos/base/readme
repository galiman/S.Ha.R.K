This directory contains a set of simple examples, useful to understand
How to make a Shark application.

Text mode demos:
- hello.c   --> a hello world application
- timer.c   --> tests if the time reads are always increasing 
	        (useful for debugging purposes)
- sig.c     --> simple example that sends signals
- semdemo.c --> simple example that uses a semaphore for mutual exclusion
- pidemo.c  --> simple example that uses PI  mutexes between NRT and Hard tasks
- pcdemo.c  --> simple example that uses PC  mutexes between NRT and Hard tasks
- srpdemo.c --> simple example that uses SRP mutexes between NRT and Hard tasks
- mdemo.c   --> simple example that uses a mutex, initialized with whatever
                protocol you want ;-)
- aster.c   --> Wow! the original Hartik ASTER demo!!! (EDF, CABs, ...)
- aster1.c  --> a -lot- of periodic tasks that are created and then die 
	        (6 seconds demo)
- aster2.c  --> a simple stress test: a lot of tasks are created until Utot=1;
	        uses jet functions to dump statistics. (60 seconds demo)
- aster3.c  --> aster2 + 8 tasks handled by 2 different TBS servers
- aster4.c  --> aster3 + CBS tasks + Shutdown demo with system tasks
- aster5.c  --> aster3 + only CBS tasks + mutexes... Really interesting!
- aster6.c  --> aster5 + Polling Server to serve the JetCtrl task
- aster7.c  --> another aster clone with Rate monotonic and Polling server
- aster8.c  --> aster5 + Sporadic Server
- preempt.c --> simple test for CBS, task_preempt, task_nopreempt, and 
	        save/skip arrivals
- pcidemo.c --> PCI Bus scan
- jointest.c--> Simple test that uses the task_join primitive
- condtest.c--> Simple test that uses condition variables
- intsem.c  --> Simple test that uses internal semaphores

Graphical demos:
- fly.c     --> Random flies going around the screen
- ego.c     --> Periodic tasks that writes a phrease on the screen
- cabs.c    --> Example that uses cabs

Note on the init files:
- ihello.c   (RR+dummy)
- isemdemo.c (iaster1+Semaphores)
- iaster1.c  (EDF+RR+dummy)
- iaster3.c  (EDF+RR+TBS(0.1)+TBS(0.3)+dummy)
- iaster4.c  (iaster3+CBS)
- initfile.c (EDF+CBS+RR+dummy, SEMaphores, CABS, HARTPORTs and Keyboard)
