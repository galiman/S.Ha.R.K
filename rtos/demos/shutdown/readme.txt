This demo shows how the SHaRK shutdown sequence works.

There are two ways to run the demo:

- the first one shows a (hopefully) correct shutdown sequence

- the second one shows an incorrect shutdows sequence, where the
  system task does not have CPU time to execute and correctly
  terminate. In this case the initializtion file posted a timeout that
  forces system shutdown.

Enjoy,
